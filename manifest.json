    "description": "The Rapid7 InsightAppSec Bamboo plugin leverages the InsightAppSec RESTful API to automate web application scanning as part of a Bamboo build or release pipeline. The plugin provides a variety of configuration options to allow for flexibility when utilized within a pipeline. This includes options for scan timeouts, status monitoring, and gating based on the results of the completed scan. This facilitates the implementation of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and enables organizations to address application security as part of the software development life cycle.",
